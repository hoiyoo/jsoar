# Java 1.6 #
JSoar require Java 1.6 which isn't installed as the default on many Macs. [This page](http://blogs.sun.com/cmar/entry/java_1_6_finally_available) describes installing Java 1.6 as the default Java.

# ScriptEngine #
**Note that you only need this to use the [JavaRhsFunction](JavaRhsFunction.md) from Soar.**

JSoar has a small dependency on the JavaScript scripting engine that is shipped with Java 1.6. Unfortunately, Apple decided to omit this from their distribution. [This page](http://jmesnil.net/weblog/2008/05/14/how-to-include-javascript-engine-in-apples-java-6-vm/) describes how to install it.
